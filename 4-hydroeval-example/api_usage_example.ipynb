To do so, import `hydroeval`, which will give you access to the `evaluator` Python function as well as all objective functions implemented in HydroEval (as Python functions as well). To evaluate the fit of observed and simulated data, you only need to call the evaluator function and provide three mandatory positional arguments: the Python function corresponding to the objective function to be used (e.g. `kge`, `nse`, etc.), the numpy array for the simulated timeseries (it can be multiple timeseries), and the numpy array for the observed timeseries (it can only contain one timeseries).

    "HydroEval can only deal with 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional numpy arrays as input. The observed numpy array can only contain one time series of flows, hence it should either be a 1-dimensional array of a 2-dimensional array with one of the two dimensions of size 1. HydroEval can evaluate multiple simulated time series against the observed time series at the same time (using vectorised calculations). Which means that the simulated time series can be a 2-dimensional array with both dimensions of size greater than 1, one of them being the time dimension and must match the length of the observed timeseries. Both observed and simulated arrays must have the same orientiation, that is to say they must have their time dimensions along the same axis. By default, HydroEval is expecting the time dimension to be on the first axis (i.e. `axis=0`) and this for both observed and simulated time series (if they are 2-dimensional of course). If this is not the case with your dataset, you need to redefine the default value of the `axis` keyword argument and set it to `1` (for the second axis). Alternatively, you can transpose your arrays before giving them to HydroEval. For multi-component objective functions such as KGE and its variants, the orientation of the input array is preserved in the output array (i.e. the time dimension will be reduced to the number of components in the objective function). For single-component objective functions such as NSE, the value returned is either a scalar if only one simulation time series is evaluated, or a 1-dimensional numpy array if the several simulation time series are evaluated."
